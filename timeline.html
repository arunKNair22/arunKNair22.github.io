        <p>Currently working as a Regional Manager at MarketOne International, leading teams across India to deliver scalable, data-driven marketing automation solutions.</p>
<p>I provide strategic leadership and technical direction to multidisciplinary teams, ensuring high-quality delivery across platforms such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo, Pardot, and Eloqua.</p>
<p>I oversee and mentor teams of skilled professionals, focusing on execution excellence, client satisfaction, and long-term value creation rather than short-term delivery.</p>
<p>I bring hands-on experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and web technologies, allowing me to bridge technical implementation with marketing strategy.</p>
<p>I actively track market dynamics, industry trends, and emerging technologies to strengthen delivery frameworks and continuously improve project outcomes.</p>
<p>I contribute to solution estimation, planning, and execution of development-led business initiatives, balancing feasibility, timelines, and impact.</p>
<p>I support business development and proposal efforts, partnering closely with clients and internal teams to drive growth and long-term engagement.</p>
<p>I collaborate with delivery and platform leads to review existing processes, identify risks, and address complexities to ensure successful project execution.</p>
<p>I maintain ongoing communication with clients and project teams, providing transparency on progress, challenges, and outcomes.</p>
